In this pandemic, everything is going slowly. My friendships are crawling. I can't get in touch with my friends in the way that we would like. We are robbed from our physical needs to meet, to touch, and to be present. However, not all is doom and gloom. Because of the reduced tempo (despite the increased tempo of work), I can take my time to really listen to my friends.

Two days ago, a good friend of mine talked to me about their paranoia over boys. This paranoia, I would love to guess, has crippled them to the point that they cannot have a healthy relationship initiations with boys.
