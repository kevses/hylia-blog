I love reading. It's – I don't know – constitutive of my moral compass. This weblog is a story of my life (hence, my reading journey). I also write another weblog, a quote blog, really, [here](https://qblog.kevses.com/).

Apart from writing, I'm studying for my master's degree. This weblog is a getaway from that reality. (But not really a getaway since I run from it while *bringing* it.)

Enjoy.
