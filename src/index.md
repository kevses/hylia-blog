My name is Kevin. I am a lecturer candidate at IISIP Jakarta. Every word here is not affiliated to it; you know the drill. I read, talk, and write International Relations for a living. It's very rewarding when I get to talk about things I enjoy the most: social agency in IR (postcolonialism, emancipation, and the like).

I'm also writing my master's thesis right now at Universitas Indonesia. It's a hard thing.

This blog is my getaway. Enjoy!
