My name is Kevin. I am a rookie lecturer at IISIP Jakarta. Every word here is not affiliated to it; you know the drill. I read International Relations for a living. I have to read and write things I don't like from time to time, but it's very rewarding when I get to talk about things I enjoy: social agency (postcolonialism, emancipation, and the like).

I'm also writing my master's thesis right now at Universitas Indonesia. It's a hard thing.

This blog is my getaway. Enjoy!
