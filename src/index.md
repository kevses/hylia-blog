I like reading. A lot.

Mostly I read journal articles. I read some philosophy. I used to read fiction a lot (I grew up with Harry Potter and finished growing up with John Grisham). They have shaped how I think about the world; they have taught me how to feel about it, in it.

And this is my weblog, created to contain and channel my thoughts and feelings.
