I like reading. A lot.

Mostly I read journal articles. They are mostly about International Relations. They involve time, inclusion (and alienation), and emotions. All relevant every day, every time.

I *used to* read fiction a lot (I grew up with *Harry Potter* and finished growing up with John Grisham). They have shaped how I think about the world; they have taught me how to feel about it, in it.

And this is my weblog, created to contain and channel my thoughts and feelings. Sometimes I write serious stuff (about time, inclusion, and emotions), sometimes less serious (also about time, inclusion, and emotions).
